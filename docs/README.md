## Features 

### Create a New Task

Create a new task that is a deadline, an event, or a to-do, and add it to Sora's 
list for her to keep track of your tasks.

### Display Your Tasks

Get Sora to display all the tasks that you have created and given to her to keep track on.

### Mark Your Tasks as Completed

Tell Sora that you have completed a task and she will update it accordingly in her list of tasks.

### Delete an Existing Task

Remove a task that you no longer wish Sora to keep track of.

### Search for an Existing Task

Enter a search query and Sora will show you the tasks that matches your search keywords.

### Automatic Saving of Task Data to Local Storage

Every time you create, update, or delete a task, Sora automatically saves these changes into a file

Sora farewell for the day and will be available the next time you start her up.

## File Storage Information

When you start Sora for the first time on a computer, the following are created:
- A directory named `CS2113T_iP_Sora_Resources`
- A text file named `data.txt` residing within the aforementioned directory.

On subsequent boot ups, Sora will automatically read the file to load the tasks created in previous
sessions onto the current one.

### Caution

The directory and text file will be created in your terminal's **current working directory**.
Thus, it is highly recommended that you **set your working directory to the directory where
Sora.jar is located in** before starting up Sora.

### Recommendation
1. Create an empty directory and place `Sora.jar` inside it.
2. Set your terminal's current working directory to the aforementioned directory.
3. Run `Sora.jar` from the directory.

This way, `Sora.jar` and your file data will be stored within the same directory.
