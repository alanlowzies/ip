# Hello, I'm Sora, Your Personal Chatbot

I am capable of keeping tabs on the tasks that you need to keep track of.

## Brief Rundown of What I Can Do
- Create one of the following three types of tasks:
    - Deadline: For tasks that you _die die_ need to complete by a certain period.
    - Event: For certain occasions such as project meetings, an upcoming exam, or that One Ok Rock concert 
  that you've been looking forward to forever.
    - Todo: For things that you plan to do (and hopefully _do_ complete it)
